Getting Started
===============

The package requires python 3.8+. The package can be installed using pip with all required dependencies::

	python3 -m pip install -e .

To update the dependencies in case anything is missing, ``requirements.txt`` can be used::

	pip install -r requirements.txt

An interactive tutorial can be found in ``tutorial/tutorial.ipynb``. The tutorial requires Jupyter notebook to run. A PDF version of the tutorial can be found in ``tutorial.pdf``.

The package comes with several examples in the ``demo/`` folder. Run these as::

	python3 demo/ball/ball_bounces.py 

Read the comments in demo/ball/ball_bounces.py to learn how to create new agents and scenarios. More detailed documentation will be here.
